Your requirement is clear, and it's an interesting visualization approach. Basically, you're looking for a multi-layered radial chart, where each "layer" (or ring) represents a different day, and each "segment" in a ring represents an appointment.

Here's a pseudo-implementation of how it might be done. It's not specific to any charting library, but rather a general approach to the problem.

Data Preparation: First, you'll need to prepare the data. You should have a data structure where for each day, you have a list of appointments. Each appointment should have a start time (in minutes since midnight) and a duration (also in minutes).

Normalization: Next, you need to normalize these times to fit within a 0-360 degree scale for the radial chart. You can do this by multiplying the time by (360 / 1440) to get the equivalent angle. Do this for both the start time and the duration.

Chart Creation: Now, you can create the chart. Each "ring" of the chart corresponds to a day, and each "segment" within that ring corresponds to an appointment.

The start angle of the segment is the normalized start time.
The sweep angle (how wide the segment is) is the normalized duration.
The inner and outer radii of the segment depend on which day it is. The inner radius could be (day number * some constant), and the outer radius could be ((day number + 1) * some constant).
Rendering: Finally, you draw the chart. Each segment is drawn as an arc with the calculated start angle, sweep angle, inner radius, and outer radius. You can use different colors or shades to distinguish between different appointments or different days.

This is a somewhat complex custom visualization, and you might not find a ready-made library that supports exactly this. However, you can create custom drawings in Android using the Canvas API, or you could potentially adapt a library that supports similar types of charts (like radial bar charts, for example) to meet your needs.

Remember to also provide some form of legend or other guidance for the user, so they understand what the different colors, shades, or other visual cues mean. You might also want to consider how you will handle overlapping appointments, or very short appointments that might not be easily visible in this format.
